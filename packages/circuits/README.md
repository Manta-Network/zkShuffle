# @zk-shuffle/circuits

Poseidon ZK circuits

## Usage

### Install this package
`yarn add @zk-shuffle/circuits`

### Use in your own circuits

`import "path/to/node_modules/@zk-shuffle/circuits/group/group.circom"` 

## Developement

Install

`yarn`

Compile circuits & generate resources including WASM & zKey & Solidity contract.
The first time you run it will take a long time because it will download the default ptau file
and save it to artifacts.

`yarn compile`

Generates checksum for the `circuits` directory and stores the checksum in `circom.checksum`. We use this checksum to avoid compiling unchanged circom codes.

`yarn checksum`

If there are updated resources before you push the code, it's better to publish the resources to Google cloud, after which the resources.json will be updated

`yarn upload`

**Use your own zkey!!!**

Be notified it's better to generate your own zkey & ptau files to set up the verifier contract!


## Test

Every circom circuits should come with an unit tests, you can take the example.circom for example
