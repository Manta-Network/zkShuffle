# Poseidon ZK Monorepo

Poseidon ZK Monorepo is a collection of useful ZK toolbox provided as NPM packages, including a variety of utilities like Circom circuit components, Solidity smart contracts and JavaScript/TypeScript SDK. By integrating these packages developers can easily enable their DApps with ZK abilities. 

## Prerequisite

**Setup Yarn v2 to enable workspace feature**
> Note: you need to migrate to Yarn v2 if not already, guide [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration). 
Follow the [Yarn official instruction](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
`npm i -g corepack`
`corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate`
`yarn plugin import workspace-tools`
Now we can use yarn workspace commands, [more info](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/workspace)

**Install**

`yarn`

After installation, the dependencies of all the packages will be installed.

**Compile all packages**

`yarn workspaces foreach run compile`

**Test all packages**

`yarn workspaces foreach run test`

## Packages

**`ðŸ’¡ @p0x-labs/poseidon-zk-circuits`**

This package contains all the Circom circuit components with related unit test cases. Circuit integrators can directly import the circuits in this package.

**Install**

`yarn install @p0x-labs/poseidon-zk-circuits`

If you want to develop based on this package, it's highly recommended to change the default `ptau` setting in `hardhat.config.ts` to your own generated trust setup.

**Compile**

`yarn compile`

Compile circuits only

`yarn compile:circuits`

Compile generated contracts only:

`yarn compile:contracts`

After running compilation, zkey files, wasm files, verifier Solidity contracts will be generated, and can be imported by JavaScript users and contract users.

**Testing**

`yarn test`

**`â›“ @p0x-labs/poseidon-zk-contracts`**

This package depends on circuit package and its generated verifier contracts. It extends the contract of verifier contracts and can be integrated by user-end developers.

**Install**

`yarn install @p0x-labs/poseidon-zk-contracts`

**Compile**

`yarn compile`

**Testing**

`yarn test`

The unit tests in contracts package use proof generation utilities from `proof` package and perform some e2e tests.

**Deploy**

`yarn deploy`

**`ðŸ›  @p0x-labs/poseidon-zk-jssdk`**

**Install**

`yarn install @p0x-labs/poseidon-zk-jssdk`

todo

**`ðŸ§¾ @p0x-labs/poseidon-zk-proof`**

This package provides some utilities for generating zk proofs and is depended by contracts package to do some unit tests.

**Install**

`yarn install @p0x-labs/poseidon-zk-proof`

**Compile**

`yarn compile`


## TODOS

- Add cryptographic tests for circuit packages
- Publish packages to NPM registry
- CI/CD
- Add JSSDK to enable JS end users
- Add contract hardhat deploy scripts
